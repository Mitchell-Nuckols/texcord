# Texcord
Very small Discord selfbot for outputting TeX formatted images.
Requires a Go environment to build binaries.

## Usage:
`texcord -t <Discord token>`

Or you can optionally set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable and simply run:

`texcord`

Messages are prefixed with "TEX: " followed by basic TeX formatting.
